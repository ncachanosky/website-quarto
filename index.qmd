:::{#about}
:::{style="text-align: justify"}

## Welcome!

I’m an Associate Professor of Economics and the Director of the [Center for Free Enterprise](https://www.utep.edu/business/c4fe/) at [The University of Texas at El Paso](https://www.utep.edu/). I’m also a Senior Fellow at the [American Institute for Economic Research](https://aier.org/) nd a Fellow at the [UCEMA Friedman-Hayek Center for the Study of a Free Society](https://ucema.edu.ar/friedman-hayek-center).

Along with [João P. Bastos](https://jpmvbastos.com/), I’m the editor of [Public Choice in Latin America](https://publicchoicelatinamerica.substack.com/). I also serve as an Associate Editor of the Southern Economic Journal. Previously, I was president of the Association of Private Enterprise Education (APEE) and a director of The Mont Pelerin Society (MPS).

This website shares information about my research, and I regularly blog at [Economic Order](https://economicorder.substack.com/) about economic policy and research.
